Feature binning is a method of dividing quantitative variables into categorical values. It groups quantitative values into a pre-defined number of bins.

If the number of bins is set to 3, the bin ranges become something like `[-Inf, 1], (1, 10], (10, Inf]`.

*Note: This feature is supported from Hivemall v0.5-rc.1 or later.*

# Usage

Prepare sample data (*users* table) first as follows:

``` sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  rowid int, name string, age int, gender string
);
INSERT INTO users VALUES
  (1, 'Jacob', 20, 'Male'),
  (2, 'Mason', 22, 'Male'),
  (3, 'Sophia', 35, 'Female'),
  (4, 'Ethan', 55, 'Male'),
  (5, 'Emma', 15, 'Female'),
  (6, 'Noah', 46, 'Male'),
  (7, 'Isabella', 20, 'Female')
;

CREATE TABLE input as
SELECT
  rowid,
  array_concat(
    categorical_features(
      array('name', 'gender'),
      name, gender
    ),
    quantitative_features(
      array('age'),
      age
    )
  ) AS features
FROM
  users;
  
select * from input limit 2;
```

| input.rowid | input.features |
|:--|:--|
|1 | ["name#Jacob","gender#Male","age:20.0"] |
|2 | ["name#Mason","gender#Male","age:22.0"] |

## Feature Vector trasformation by applying Feature Binning

Now, converting `age` values into 3 bins.

```sql
SELECT
  map('age', build_bins(age, 3)) AS quantiles_map
FROM
  users
```

> {"age":[-Infinity,18.333333333333332,30.666666666666657,Infinity]}

In the above query result, you can find 4 values for age in `quantiles_map`. It's a threshold of 3 bins. 

```sql
WITH bins as (
  SELECT
    map('age', build_bins(age, 3)) AS quantiles_map
  FROM
    users
)
select
  feature_binning(
    array('age:-Infinity', 'age:-1', 'age:0', 'age:1', 'age:18.333333333333331', 'age:18.333333333333332'), quantiles_map
  ),
  feature_binning(
    array('age:18.3333333333333333', 'age:18.33333333333334', 'age:19', 'age:30', 'age:30.666666666666656', 'age:30.666666666666657'), quantiles_map
  ),
  feature_binning(
    array('age:666666666666658', 'age:30.66666666666666', 'age:31', 'age:99', 'age:Infinity'), quantiles_map
  ),
  feature_binning(
    array('age:NaN'), quantiles_map
  ),
  feature_binning( -- not in map
    array('weight:60.3'), quantiles_map
  )
from
  bins
```

> ["age:0","age:0","age:0","age:0","age:0","age:0"]       ["age:0","age:1","age:1","age:1","age:1","age:1"]       ["age:2","a
ge:2","age:2","age:2","age:2"]  ["age:3"]       ["weight:60.3"]

The following query shows more practical usage:

``` sql
WITH bins AS (
  SELECT
    map('age', build_bins(age, 3)) AS quantiles_map
  FROM
    users
)
SELECT
  feature_binning(features, quantiles_map) AS features
FROM
  input
  CROSS JOIN bins;
```

| features: `array<features::string>` |
| :-- |
| ["name#Jacob","gender#Male","age:1"] |
| ["name#Mason","gender#Male","age:1"] |
| ["name#Sophia","gender#Female","age:2"] |
| ["name#Ethan","gender#Male","age:2"] |
| ... |

## More practical Example

Hivemall's 

```sql
WITH extracted as (
  select 
    extract_feature(feature) as index,
    extract_weight(feature) as value
  from
    input l
    LATERAL VIEW explode(features) r as feature
),
mapping as (
  select
    index, 
    build_bins(value, 5, true) as quantiles -- 5 bins with auto bin shrinking
  from
    extracted
  group by
    index
),
bins as (
   select 
    to_map(index, quantiles) as quantiles 
   from
    mapping
)
select
  l.features as original,
  feature_binning(l.features, r.quantiles) as features
from
  input l
  cross join bins r
-- limit 10;
```

| original | features |
|:--|:--|
| ["name#Jacob","gender#Male","age:20.0"] | ["name#Jacob","gender#Male","age:2"] |
| ["name#Isabella","gender#Female","age:20.0"] | ["name#Isabella","gender#Female","age:2"] |
| ... | ... |


## Get a mapping table by Feature Binning

```sql
WITH bins AS (
  SELECT build_bins(age, 3) AS quantiles
  FROM users
)
SELECT
  age, feature_binning(age, quantiles) AS bin
FROM
  users CROSS JOIN bins;
```

| age:` int` | bin: `int` |
|:-:|:-:|
| 20 | 1 |
| 22 | 1 |
| 35 | 2 |
| 55 | 2 |
| 15 | 0 |
| 46 | 2 |
| 20 | 1 |

# Function Signatures

### UDAF `build_bins(weight, num_of_bins[, auto_shrink])`

#### Input

| weight: int&#124;bigint&#124;float&#124;double | num\_of\_bins: `int` | [auto\_shrink: `boolean` = false] |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| weight | 2 <= | behavior when separations are repeated: T=\>skip, F=\>exception |

#### Output

| quantiles: `array<double>` |
| :-: |
| array of separation value |

> #### Note
> There is the possibility quantiles are repeated because of too many `num_of_bins` or too few data.
> If `auto_shrink` is true, skip duplicated quantiles. If not, throw an exception.

### UDF `feature_binning(features, quantiles_map)`

#### Input 

| features: `array<features::string>` | quantiles\_map: `map<string, array<double>>` |
| :-: | :-: |
| serialized feature | entry:: key: col name, val: quantiles |

#### Output

| features: `array<feature::string>` |
| :-: |
| serialized and binned features |

### UDF `feature_binning((weight, quantiles)`

#### Input

| weight: int&#124;bigint&#124;float&#124;double | quantiles: `array<double>` |
| :-: | :-: |
| weight | array of separation value |

#### Output
