[Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) is a ranking function for documents for a given query.

It can also be used for a better replacement of [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) and can be used for term-weight for each document.

# The ranking function

Given a query $$Q$$, containing keywords $$q1,....,q_n$$, the BM25 score of a document $$D$$ is:

$$
score(Q, D) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}IDF(q_{i}) \cdot \frac{tf(q_{i},D) \cdot (k_{1}+1)}{tf(q_{i},D) + k_{1} \cdot (1 - b + b \cdot \frac{|D|}{avgdl})}
$$

where $$tf(q_{i}, D)$$ is $$q_{i}$$'s term frequency in the document $$D$$, $$|D|$$ is the length of the document $$D$$ in words, and $$avgdl$$ is the average document length in the text collection from which documents are drawn. $$k_{1}$$ and $$b$$ are free parameters, usually chosen, in absence of an advanced optimization, as $$k_{1} \in [1.2,2.0]$$ and $$b = 0.75$$.

BM25 can also be applied for term weighing, showing how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus, as follows:

$$
score(t_{i}, D) = IDF(t_{i}) \cdot \frac{tf(t_{i},D) \cdot (k_{1}+1)}{tf(t_{i},D) + k_{1} \cdot (1 - b + b \cdot \frac{|D|}{avgdl})}
$$

where $$t_{i}$$ is a term appeared in document $$D$$.

# Data preparation

In similar to [TF-IDF](./tfidf), you need to prepare a relation consists of (docid,word) tuples to compute BM25 score.

```sql
create external table wikipage (
  docid int,
  page string
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

cd ~/tmp
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/myui/190b91a3a792ccfceda0/raw/327acd192da4f96da8276dcdff01b19947a4373c/tfidf_test.tsv

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/myui/tmp/tfidf_test.tsv' INTO TABLE wikipage;

create or replace view wikipage_exploded
as
select
  docid, 
  word
from
  wikipage LATERAL VIEW explode(tokenize(page,true)) t as word
where
  not is_stopword(word);
```

# Define views of TF/DF

```
create or replace view frequency
as
select
  docid,
  word,
  count(1) as freq
from
  wikipage_exploded
group by
  docid,
  word
;
```
