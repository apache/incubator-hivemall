# Apache Hivemall Release Guide

This document describes the release process of Apache Hivemall particularly for [Release Managers](http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html#glossary-release-manager).

For general information of the Apache Incubator release process, please refer [Incubator Release Management](http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html) and [ASF Release Poloicy](http://www.apache.org/dev/#releases) page.

## Prerequisites

If it is your first time doing an Apache release, then there is some initial setup involved. Follow [this guide](./release-setup.html) for the initial setup.

1. Notifying the community the overall plan for the release
2. Ensure JIRA Issues are appropriately tagged for the Release 
    - [Check this link](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVEMALL-162?jql=project%20%3D%20HIVEMALL%20AND%20status%20in%20\(Resolved%2C%20Closed\)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20EMPTY) for `CLOSED/RESOLVED` issues that does not have `FixVersion`.
    - Then, ensure that all JIRA issues that are addressed in this release are marked with the release version in the `FixVersion` field of the issue. [Here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVEMALL-157?jql=project%20%3D%20HIVEMALL%20AND%20status%20in%20\(Resolved%2C%20Closed\)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%200.5.0) is an example for v0.5.0 release.

## UPDATE CHANGELOG

1. Create a release note in JIRA following [this instructions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver071/creating-release-notes-802592502.html).
2. Download a release note as `ChangeLog.html` using [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ConfigureReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12320630).

## TEST YOUR SETTINGS

Try installing locally artifacts with activation apache-release profile. The following command will build artifacts, sources and sign. 

**Note:** _Apache Hivemall keeps class file compatibility to Java 7 but requires Java 8 for packaging._

```sh
# JDK 8 is required for packaging
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`

# Try to create artifacts
export MAVEN_OPTS=-XX:MaxPermSize=256m

# (Optional) Workaround for SSL error `Received fatal alert: protocol_version`
export MAVEN_OPTS="$MAVEN_OPTS -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"

mvn -Papache-release clean install
```

Ensure that all unit tests passes. License check by Apache RAT (`mvn apache-rat:check`) will be ran by the above commands.

## SNAPSHOT RELEASE

### PREPARE YOUR POMS FOR RELEASE

**1)** Switch to master syncing to ASF master

```sh
git checkout master
git fetch
git pull # or, git reset --hard asf/master
```

**2)** Set version string for a snapshot

```sh
version=X.Y.Z
# echo "${version}-incubating-SNAPSHOT"

./bin/set_version.sh --pom --version "${version}-incubating-SNAPSHOT"
```

**Note:** _`--pom` option SHOULD only used for SNAPSHOT release._

```sh
git commit -a -m "Prepare for the next Snapshot release of X.Y.Z"
git push asf master
```

**3)** Perform a dryRun

```sh
version=X.Y.Z
# RC should start at 1 and increment if early release candidates fail to release
rc=1
next_version=X.(Y+1).Z

# Confirm that version and rc is defined.
echo "Release version: ${version}-incubating"
echo "Development version: ${next_version}-incubating-SNAPSHOT"

mvn -Papache-release release:prepare \
  -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DdryRun=true \
  -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true' -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true \
  -Dtag=v${version}-rc${rc} -DreleaseVersion=${version}-incubating -DdevelopmentVersion=${next_version}-incubating-SNAPSHOT
```

**Note:** `-rcX` is only used for git tag. Release candidates do NOT have `-rcX` for artifact versions in pom. Release candidates are just for voting.

### PUBLISH A SNAPSHOT

```sh
mvn deploy \
  -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true' -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

**Note:** _You SHOULD verify the deployment under [the Maven Snapshot repository at Apache](https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/hivemall/)._

## PREPARE THE RELEASE

### BRANCH THE RELEASE

**1)** Create a branch

```sh
git checkout -b vX.Y.Z
```

**Note:** _Branch name starts with `v` and does not include `-rcX`._

**2)** Send e-mail announcing the release branch

```
To: dev@hivemall.incubator.apache.org
CC: private@hivemall.incubator.apache.org
Subject: New release branch X.Y.Z

Hello Hivemall developers and friends,

We now have a release branch for X.Y.Z release. Trunk has been bumped to X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.

  https://github.com/apache/incubator-hivemall/tree/vX.Y.Z

I'll be going over the JIRAs to move every non-blocker from this release to the next release. Release voting will be posted soon.
```

### PREPARE A RELEASE

**1)** Set a release version

```sh
version=X.Y.Z
rc=1
next_version=X.(Y+1).Z

# Confirm that version and rc is defined.
echo "${version}-incubating (Release Candidates ${rc})"
# 0.5.0-incubating (Release Candidates 3)
```

**2)** Update version strings in source codes.

```sh
./bin/set_version.sh --version "${version}-incubating"

# Check list of files to be committed.
git status
git commit -a -m "Bumped version string to ${version}-incubating"
```

**3)** Prepare sets the version numbers in POM and creates a tag.

```sh
mvn -Papache-release release:clean release:prepare \
  -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DdryRun=false \
  -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true' -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true \
  -Dtag=v${version}-rc${rc} -DreleaseVersion=${version}-incubating -DdevelopmentVersion=${next_version}-incubating-SNAPSHOT
```

**4)** Update version strings for the development iteration

```sh
./bin/set_version.sh --version "${next_version}-incubating-SNAPSHOT"

# Check list of files to be committed.
git stauts
git commit --amend -a
```

**5)** Push release branch and tag to remote ASF repository

```sh
# Push the release branch
git push asf v${version}

# Push the release tag
git push asf v${version}-rc${rc}
```

## STAGE THE RELEASE FOR A VOTE

The release will automatically be inserted into a temporary staging repository for you.

```sh
mvn -Papache-release release:perform \
  -Darguments='-Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true' -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true \
  -Dgoals=deploy -DlocalRepoDirectory=. -DlocalCheckout=true
```

### Verify nexus release artifacts

1. Verify the staged artifacts in the nexus repo
  - Go to [https://repository.apache.org/](https://repository.apache.org/) and login
  - Under `Build Promotion`, click `Staging Repositories`
  - In the `Staging Repositories` tab there should be a line with profile `org.apache.hivemall`
  - Navigate through the artifact tree and make sure that all javadoc, sources, tests, and jars have .asc (GPG signature). Refer [the ASF page](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html#verifying-signature) for artifacts verification.
2. Close the nexus staging repo
  - Check the box on in the first column of the row, and press the ‘Close’ button to publish the repository at [https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehivemall-1001/](https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehivemall-1001/) (or a similar URL)

### Attach signatures for shaded jars

Shaded jars does not have signatures. So, attach signatures to them as follows:

```sh
cd target/

# Sign to the artifacts created by maven-shade-plugin
for f in `ls hivemall-*-with-dependencies*.jar`; do
  gpg --armor --output ${f}.asc --detach-sig ${f}
  shasum -a 512 ${f} | cut -f1 -d' '  > ${f}.sha512
done

# Verify GPG sign
for file in `find . -type f -iname 'hivemall-*-with-dependencies*.jar.asc'`; do
  echo ${file}
  gpg --verify ${file}
  echo
done
```

### Upload the artifacts via subversion to a staging area

- Prepare release artifacts in SVN repository

```sh
# Checkout release SVN repository
mkdir -p dist/dev/incubator
cd dist/dev/incubator
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hivemall/
cd hivemall

# Download release artifacts
wget -e robots=off --no-check-certificate \
 -r -np --reject=html,txt,tmp -nH --cut-dirs=7 \
 https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachehivemall-1001/org/apache/hivemall/hivemall/${version}-incubating/

# Rename directory for RC
mv ${version}-incubating ${version}-incubating-rc${rc}

# Put ChangeLog
cd ${version}-incubating-rc${rc}
# Put ChangeLog generated by JIRA
cp ~/Downloads/ChangeLog.html .

# Put Shaded jars
cp ~/incubator-hivemall/target/hivemall-*-with-dependencies*.jar* .

# Remove deprecated md5 and sha1
# See https://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution.html#sigs-and-sums

ls *.md5 *.sha1
rm *.md5 *.sha1

# Add SHA-512 checksum

for f in hivemall-0.5.2-incubating-site.xml hivemall-0.5.2-incubating-source-release.zip hivemall-0.5.2-incubating.pom; do
  shasum -a 512 ${f} | cut -f1 -d' '  > ${f}.sha512
  ls ${f}.sha512
done
```

- Push release arfifacts to ASF svn repository

```sh
cd dist/dev/incubator/hivemall
# ls ${version}-incubating-rc${rc}

svn add ${version}-incubating-rc${rc}/
svn commit -m "Put hivemall version ${version}-incubating-rc${rc} artifacts"
```

### Verify Release Artifacts

- Check release artifacts are properly deployed in the SVN repository: [https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hivemall/X.Y.Z-incubating-rcZ/](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hivemall/0.5.0-incubating-rc1/)

=====
*Disclaimer*
Apache Hivemall (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the name of Apache
Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent
with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
```
