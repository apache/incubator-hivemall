# Release Prerequisites

This document describes the initial setup procedures for making a release of Apache Hivemall.

If it is your first time doing an Apache release, then there is some initial setup involved. You should read this page before proceeding. 

## Software

You would need the following softwares for building and making a release:

- gpg2
- git client
- svn client (_svn is still mandatory in the ASF distribution process. Don't ask me why._)
- JDK 7 (_not JDK 8 nor 9 to support Java 7 or later_)
- maven

### Installation

	```sh
	# on Mac
	brew install gpg gpg-agent pinentry-mac
	brew intall svn
	brew install maven
	```

### Java 7 setup (Optional)

We recommend to use [jEnv](http://www.jenv.be/) for Java 7 environment setup on Mac OS X.

	```sh
	$ /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7
	  /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home
	$ jenv add `/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7`
	$ jenv versions
	* system (set by /Users/myui/.jenv/version)
	  1.7
	  1.7.0.80
	  oracle64-1.7.0.80
	
	# configure to use Java 7 for Hivemall
	$ cd incubator-hivemall
	$ jenv local 1.7
	$ java -version
	  java version "1.7.0_80"
	```

## PGP signing

To perform a release, you need to add signatures to release packages.
See the [Signing Releases](http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html) page for information on how to do this.

In a nutshell, you'll need to follow the instructions at [How To OpenPGP](http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#generate-key) to generate a new code signing key and publish the public key in various places.

### Setting up signing keys

1. Generate a key-pair with gpg using [this instruction](http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#key-gen-generate-key). The program's default values should be fine. Please use a signing key with an ASF email address (i.e. your-alias@apache.org). Generated Keys should be RSA with at least 4096 bits.

	`$ gpg --full-generate-key`

	Here is my key.

	```
	$ gpg --list-key --keyid-format LONG
	
	pub   rsa4096/93F4D08DC8CE801B 2017-11-01 [SC]
	      7A6BA1A10CC6ABF47159152193F4D08DC8CE801B
	uid                 [ultimate] Makoto Yui (CODE SIGNING KEY) <myui@apache.org>
	sub   rsa4096/C3F1C8E219A64221 2017-11-01 [E]
	```

	Public key is `93F4D08DC8CE801B` in the above case.

2. Send your public PGP key to a public keyserver.

	`$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys <your-public-pgp-key>`

3. Update the PGP key fingerprint of your account on [id.apache.org](http://id.apache.org). Find your PGP key fingerprint by 

	`$ gpg --fingerprint`

4. Update KEYS file in the git repo to your public key be listed in it.

	```sh
	$ export YOUR_NAME="Makoto Yui"
	$ (gpg --list-sigs ${YOUR_NAME} && gpg --armor --export ${YOUR_NAME} && echo) >> KEYS
	
	# Update git repository
	$ git add KEYS
	$ git commit -m "Added the public key of YOUR NAME"
	$ git push origin master
	```
5. Add your public key to KEYS file in the subversion repository:

	- dev: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/hivemall/KEYS
	- release: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/hivemall/KEYS

	```sh
	# checkout dist repos
	$ svn co --depth immediates https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist dist
	$ cd dist
	$ svn up --set-depth infinity dev/incubator/hivemall
	$ svn up --set-depth infinity release/incubator/hivemall
	
	# edit KEYS files
	$ svn add * --force
	$ svn ci -m "Updated KEYS file of Incubator Hivemall" && svn up
	```

6. Once you have followed these instructions, you should have:

	* Your public key viewable at https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/your-asf-id.asc
	* Your public key also viewable at https://people.apache.org/keys/group/hivemall.asc

#### Configure PGP signing on git (optional)

After completing this, you should also [configure git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) to use your key for signing.

If your signing key is identified by `01234567`, then you can configure git with:

    `$ git config --global user.signingkey 01234567`

If you are using gpg, you'll then need to tell git to use it.

    `$ git config --global gpg.program gpg`

You can enable GPG signing always true on the particular git repository by:

	`$ git config commit.gpgsign true`

Use pientry to omit typing a passphrase for each commit.

	```sh
	$ echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
	$ echo -e "use-agent\nno-tty" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
	```

Tip: You may get an error about a passphrase not being provided when signing with git.  If this happens try running the command below, which should case the passphrase prompt to show in the terminal.

    export GPG_TTY=`tty`

## Configure Maven for publishing artifacts

Update your `~/.m2/settings.xml` following [this instructions](http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#dev-env).

```xml
<settings>
...
  <servers>
    <!-- To publish a snapshot of some part of Maven -->
    <server>
      <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
      <username> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP USERNAME --> </username>
      <password> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP PASSWORD (encrypted) --> </password>
    </server>
    <!-- To stage a release of some part of Maven -->
    <server>
      <id>apache.releases.https</id>
      <username> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP USERNAME --> </username>
      <password> <!-- YOUR APACHE LDAP PASSWORD (encrypted) --> </password>
    </server>
   ...
  </servers>
</settings>
```
